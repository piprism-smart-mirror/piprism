# PiPrism Smart Mirror

This is my version of a smart mirror. </br>
It consist of two main parts:
<ul>
  <li>Vue.js client-side - provides flexible modern UI</li>
  <li>Python Flask server-side - supplements the client with back end functionality that is way too complicated and/or cannot be implemented at all with Java Script and web-based frameworks</li>
</ul>

## It should provide the next features:

<ul>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Google Assistant voice control with addition of custom commands</li>
  <li>&#10004;&nbsp Show date, time, weather, news, etc</li>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Display data from sensors (like temperature inside the house)</li>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Control various devices inside the house</li>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Remote control via smartphone</li>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Play music using Spotify</li>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Take notes</li>
  <li>&#10006;&nbsp Detect user presence and turn the lighting accordingly</li>
</ul>

## Client Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
